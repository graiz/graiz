# Hi there, I'm Greg Raiz! 👋  

I'm an entrepreneur and tech enthusiast who loves turning abstract ideas into impactful companies. I currently wear the hat of the General Partner at [FoundersEdge](https://foundersedge.com), a venture capital firm that works hands-on with early-stage founders. We invest at the **pre-seed** stage, leveraging a **data-driven** approach to identify promising founders and accelerate their growth.  

## A Bit About My Background 📚  

- **FoundersEdge:** At FoundersEdge, we believe that *founders are the unfair advantage for future founders*. We take an hands-on approach, working closely with startups, providing guidance, mentorship, and investor connections. Our model is designed for experienced founders who don’t need basic startup guidance but thrive with strategic support.  
- **Techstars Boston:** I was the Managing Director at Techstars Boston, helping early-stage startups refine their strategies, scale, and raise capital.  
- **Raizlabs:** I was the founder and CEO of Raizlabs, a pioneering mobile technology firm that landed on the **Inc. 5000 list four times**. We built innovative apps for brands like AAA, Dunkin’, and Macy’s. In 2017, I sold the company and stayed on as Chief Innovation Officer.  
- **Product & AI Development:** I’ve helped launch **hundreds** of products across mobile, AI, and emerging tech. I’m passionate about **AI-first product design**, ensuring AI is deeply embedded in user experiences rather than just bolted on.  
- **Education:** I hold a **Computer Science degree** from Tufts University.

## Giving Back & Staying Connected 💼🚀  

I’m deeply involved in **Boston’s startup ecosystem**, hosting events like **Ditch the Deck** and **Funders & Founders** in Connecticut. I also co-host **PEF Boston**, a community of post-exit-founders, investors, and operators.  

## Speaking & Engaging 🎤💡  

I regularly speak at industry events on topics like **AI-first product design, startup investing, and the future of technology**.
